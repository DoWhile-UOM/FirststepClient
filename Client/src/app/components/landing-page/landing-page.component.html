        <p>In today's competitive job market, job seekers often face difficulties in finding relevant job opportunities and dealing with complex 
          application processes. Employers also struggle to find suitable candidates efficiently. This platform mainly targets fresh graduates who 
          encounter many challenges in finding their first job. Therefore, it is named FirstStep. We want these fresh graduates to find good jobs 
          that match their skillsets and more, and for employers to hire new talents.
          <br>
          The need for a separate platform to find job vacancies comes when job seekers need to find up-to-date job vacancies that are relevant to 
          their field of work. Additionally, applying for a job can be time-consuming. Job seekers may need to complete forms, write cover letters, 
          and modify resumes for each application. They often receive little to no feedback from employers, even after submitting applications or 
          attending interviews. This platform aims to solve these problems by providing a simple, user-friendly interface for both job seekers and 
          employers. The motivation behind this project is to make the job-matching process more efficient and effective
